From just one branch in Indore, we have expanded to having 6 branches and 3 libraries. From having a few students to having more than a 1000, we have come a long way. And it has been possible only because of your trust in our institute.
				
				Our faculty strength has also increased from the time of our establishment to now and we intend to bring the best faculties available so that our students can get the most out of their time spent with us. You will find that our faculties are the most experienced experts in their field and they try to find innovative ways of teaching their students so that learning can be made fun and easy.

				We also aim to help students from underprivileged backgrounds to dream and believe that their dream of become a civil servant is possible to achieve. Through our initiatives like "Samarthya Ko Salam" we are trying to do just that by giving scholarships worth up to Rs. 1 Crore to students so that the students who are talented but don't have the means to get the best facilities and can pursue a career in civil services.
